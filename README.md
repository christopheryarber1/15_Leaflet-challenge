Leaflet Homework - Mapping

This assignment was pretty similar to an activity done earlier in class. Was able to re-create that functionality, and add a legend, while adjusting some of the values that needed to be provided for the markers. Centered up on hometown, and zoomed out a bit to cover some more area.
